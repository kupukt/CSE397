# Week 01 Career Prep: Getting Word Out Goals

## SMART Goals Research:
**What is a SMART goal?**  
A SMART goal is a goal that is Specific, meaning it's clearly defined, Measurable, so I can track progress, Achievable, meaning it's realistic, Relevant, so it aligns with what I want to accomplish, and Time-bound, meaning it has a deadline. This helps me stay focused and work toward something I know I can reach within a set timeframe.
